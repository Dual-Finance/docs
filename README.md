# Overview

[Dual Finance](https://www.dual.finance/) gives token communities sustainable ways to earn yield & generate value from their treasuries. Through liquid option based incentives, Dual Finance unlocks value & unleashes participation in decentralized communities. Goodbye inflationary token rewards. Hello sustainable Staking Options.

Dual Finance has designed itself upon this breakthrough token incentive mechanism to gain allegiance & prevent token dumping. DUAL token distribution is being conducted fully & fairly through the use of Staking Options (SOs).

Partner projects can use Staking Options themselves via Dual Finance to better incentivize their own communities. When designed through Dual Finance, Staking Options serve to bolster their token's option & spot liquidity by utilizing a DAO owned AMM (Risk Manager) and capitally efficient lending product (Rehypothecated Lending Pools).

Completing the offering are Dual Investment Pools (DIPs), an upgrade to conventional option vaults (DOVs) that offer streaming executable yield strategies. Customize strategies based on your risk appetite and earn yield immediately.
