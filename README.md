# Overview

[Dual Finance](https://www.dual.finance/) gives token communities sustainable
ways to generate value from their treasuries. Through liquid option based
incentives, Dual Finance unleashes participation in decentralized communities.
Goodbye inflationary token rewards. Hello sustainable Staking Options.

Dual Finance has designed itself upon this breakthrough token incentive
mechanism to gain allegiance and prevent token dumping. DUAL token distribution
is being conducted fully and fairly through the use of Staking Options (SOs).

Partner projects can use Staking Options themselves via Dual Finance to better
incentivize their own communities. Staking Options serve to bolster their token
liquidity by utilizing a DAO owned AMM (Risk Manager).

An example of a product created by Dual Finance utilizing these Staking Options
is Dual Investment Pools (DIPs), an upgrade to conventional option vaults (DOVs)
that offer streaming executable yield strategies. Customize strategies based on
your risk appetite and earn yield immediately.
