Dual DAO Constitution

\
We, the members of the Dual DAO, set forth to establish a bonafide decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that will contribute in perpetuity to develop, support & utilize a sustainable incentive liquidity infrastructure for Web3. The cornerstone of this governance and maintenance creates aligned incentives and encourages a diverse set of participants to guide the future of the protocol using the Dual DAO token (DUAL). The constitution exhibits a compensatory benefit plan for ongoing & future contributors to the Dual DAO.\
\
DUAL serves as a governance tool, platform utility & incentive mechanism for DAO members to contribute to the success of the Dual DAO. To achieve this the Dual DAO is limiting the usage of the DUAL token as far as compensatory benefits to creating options, specifically Staking Options developed by Dual Finance. The products, technology and systems utilized by the Dual DAO embody the goal of designing aligned tokenomics & exemplify the benefits to the outside ecosystem. Explicitly, the only way DUAL ever circulates publicly and leaves the Dual DAO treasury is from Staking Option exercise.\
\
The Dual DAO is an open & transparent organization and will always be free to participate in. The public may join initially by contributing in or using products to benefit the Dual DAO. Earning Staking Options are the single entrance mechanism for participants; never will tokens be sold directly from the Dual DAO. Contributions to the Dual DAO are actively encouraged, can come in a variety of forms and are not necessarily limited to users, developers & partners, but anything the Dual DAO collectively decides are activities worth rewarding.

\


The core motivations for using Staking Options are to indirectly support token liquidity, to incentivize future beneficial contributions and to distribute tokens fairly across sets of participants. Therefore, Staking Options may not ever be created that are considered in-the-money or be granted in such size to be interpreted as irrational, unfair or abusive to existing Dual DAO members. In the Dual DAO’s best faith, Staking Option rewards will match the level of the contribution, partnership or participation. The Dual DAO’s token resources are fixed and limited. The total supply of DUAL is hard capped at 1B tokens as the treasury’s mint authority has been burned.

\


DUAL and its associated Staking Options are fungible and no limitations are enforced on the use of the token outside of the Dual DAO. However, no direct financial benefits are to be bestowed to holders of the DUAL token, such as revenue sharing or dividends & no secondary markets for DUAL will be seeded, supported or endorsed by the Dual DAO. The Dual DAO currently has no legal status, but is being constituted here with the intention of immediately finding and voting on a reputable jurisdiction and framework for which members of the Dual DAO are compliant and legally shielded from personal liability.

\


To participate in governance directly, DUAL tokens must be locked on Realms for the duration of a proposal. Parameters for initiating proposals & achieving quorum have been set sufficiently low to allow for functioning token governance, while DUAL mostly exists as Staking Option collateral. As more DUAL circulates, the Dual DAO has the ability to adjust these limits to prevent a minority of holders from controlling voting.

\


A temporary Dual DAO council has been installed with the mandate of securing the programs & treasury against exploitation, while the DUAL token governance constituted here forms naturally. The council and token function as separate but equal approval systems, each has veto power over the other.  The council is committed to transitioning away from all treasury governance after the longer of 6 months or 10 consecutive proposals that successfully reach the voting quorum, which has been initially set to 1% of total supply. As necessitated and determined by token governance, the council may continue to exist for specific program update responsibilities to mitigate exploits.

\
The principles set forth in this constitution serve as guidelines while the underlying program code establishes the functional framework for the Dual DAO. The process of achieving true decentralization for a highly complex protocol will be arduous, but by constituting itself here under these principles it will be well organized into the future to achieve its goals.\
\
The Ratification of the Dual DAO Constitution will be executed by majority rule of the Dual DAO and signed on the Solana blockchain as will any amendments and future proposals.\
