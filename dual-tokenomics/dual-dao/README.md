# Dual DAO

Dual DAO is hosted on [Realms](https://app.realms.today/dao/dual%20dao).\
\
The DAO enables participants to deposit DUAL tokens in return for eligibility to create and vote on governance proposals. To create a proposal, a user must deposit 100,000 DUAL tokens. There is no minimum deposit size to vote on a proposal. There is no lock-up period for the deposit; users can withdraw their tokens at any time. However, to vote on proposals, your DUAL must remain deposited on realms until the proposal you wish to vote on is finalized. The voting window is currently set to 3 days. The quorum to pass any governance proposal is set to 1% of the total token supply.\

\
The Dual DAO has a treasury that includes all of the un-vested DUAL tokens. In addition, the Dual DAO earns fees on DIPs and exercised SOs.\
