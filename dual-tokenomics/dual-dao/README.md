# Dual DAO

Dual DAO is hosted on [Realms](https://app.realms.today/dao/dual%20dao).\
\
The DAO enables participants to deposit DUAL tokens in return for elibility to vote on governace proposals. There is no minimum deposit size and there is no lock-up period for the deposit; users can withdraw their tokens at any time.\
\
The Dual DAO has a treasury that includes all of the un-vested DUAL tokens. In addition, the DUAL DAO earns fees on DIPs and exercised SOs.\
\
Participants in governance may be eligible to earn further DUAL Staking Options ("Proof-of-Governance Airdrops"). Keep a close eye on Realms and/or the discord [Governance channel](https://discord.com/channels/937797334048325673/1071855278808637560) for upcoming proposals.
