# Market Liquidity

A main benefit of launching only using options on DUAL is it allows community led liquidity to form naturally. \
\
Participants must exercise Staking Options to ever own DUAL and be DAO members. However as the Constitution states, the DAO is unable to limit the use of the token on the secondary market.\
\
The USDC from exercise of any DUAL Staking Options goes to the Dual DAO which holders subsequently have governance over. Rational participants should be unwilling to sell below strike prices they exercise, since alternatively the DAO in theory could vote to send any treasury assets back to its token holders.\
\
\
Markets are NOT being seeded or sponsored by the team or the Dual DAO\
