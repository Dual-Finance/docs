# Token Liquidity

A main benefit of launching only using options on DUAL is it allows community led liquidity to form naturally. \
\
Options circulating in the market as opposed to underlying tokens, reduce
inflation while bootstrapping liquidity. Apart from the incentive benefits of
using option rewards, this is the driving influence as to why this system can
benefit illiquid crypto token networks.

Participants must exercise Staking Options to purchase DUAL from the DAO and become DAO members. However as the Constitution states, the DAO is unable to limit the use of the token on the secondary market.\
\
The USDC from exercise of any DUAL Staking Options goes to the Dual DAO treasury
over which holders subsequently have governance.\
