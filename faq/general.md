# General

**What are DIPs?** \
Dual Investment Pools, similar in structure to more commonly known Decentralized Option Vaults (DOVs) but with real-time pricing and customizable risk levels. Users get paid USDC immediately for staking crypto.

**What are Staking Options?** \
A generalized form of options that are designed to be applied as an incentive tool for projects & participants to have a further "stake" in the token.&#x20;

**What are some applications of Staking Options?** \
Liquidity, Airdrops, Governance, Participation, Loyalty, Contributions etc. Staking Options are a better reward than simple token rewards for whatever is determined to be in the best interest of the project!

**Why are Staking Options better rewards than Tokens?** \
Dump Protection - non-inflationary since the strike limits supply; Timed Motivation - options expire so encourages to work towards goals in set period of time; Price Stability - introduces gamma which allows for easier market making of tokens

**Where can you buy DUAL tokens?** \
The only way to acquire tokens directly is from Staking Option exercise, but several DEXs have community led liquidity. \
See:

[token-liquidity](../dual-tokenomics/token-liquidity/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

**Is Dual audited and Open Source?** \
Not formally audited. Most of the programs are open source with DAO owned program authorities with the intent being to make all of them like that. See:

{% content-ref url="../extra/security.md" %}
[security.md](../extra/security.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

**What is the DUAL DAO?** \
The decentralized governance body controlled by DUAL token holders on Realms. Fees generated by Dual Finance accrue to the Dual DAO treasury. See:

{% content-ref url="../dual-tokenomics/dual-dao/" %}
[dual-dao](../dual-tokenomics/dual-dao/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

**What is the mission of the project?** \
To fix cryptoâ€™s broken tokenomic incentive structures through sustainable option based pathways.

**How can non-technical people contribute?**\
Non-Technical contributors should reach out in discord by creating a
[ticket](https://discord.com/channels/937797334048325673/1070906120622854154) or
creating a thread in the [#governance channel](https://discord.com/channels/937797334048325673/1071855278808637560).
Explain the scope of work you which to conduct, your background and why you're
well suited for that work. Elaborate on how the Dual DAO stands to benefit from
the work and any milestones or deliverables that will be produced. The more
detail in your proposal better. All contributions are eligible for DUAL Staking
Option rewards subject to Dual DAO approval.

**How can non-technical people contribute?**\
Technical contributors can fork and make Pull Requests directly into the Dual
Finance Github repositories. A good first place to look for issues is in the
[Status repo](https://github.com/Dual-Finance/status/issues)!&#x20;
