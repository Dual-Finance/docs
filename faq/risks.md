# Risks

**Q: What do you mean by UPSIDE vs DOWNSIDE options?** \
A: Upside DIPs are covered call options and Downside DIPs are protected put options since they are fully collateralized positions. Yield as an option premium is paid to sell the "upside" or "downside" outcomes.\
Similar for Staking Options, Upside = Calls, Downside = Puts.

**Q: Can I withdraw after staking but before expiration?** \
A: No, DIPs can only be withdrawn after expiration. However, you receive the premium amount upfront upon staking, which can be put to use elsewhere.

**Q: What happens to my Staking Option tokens after expiration if they are OTM?** \
A: If you choose not to exercise an Staking Option because it is out of the money (OTM), the option expires worthless. The Staking Options tokens will remain in your wallet, but they are not exercisable.

**Q: What is the worst-case scenario?** \
A: Since there is no leverage offered, the worst-case scenario is that you end up with all stablecoins, effectively selling your tokens at the strike price, if the market goes up significantly while you are staked, and the DUAL Staking Option you earned is OTM. There are additional risks when exercising a Staking Option (SO), so always do your own research before exercising any SO and make sure the price makes sense to exercise.

**Q: What is the best-case scenario?** \
A: The best-case scenario is that you earn the premium immediately from staking into a DIP, and the staked asset's price at expiry is just below the strike price. Additionally, the DUAL Staking Option you earned goes deep in the money (ITM), allowing you to exercise and profit by buying for the strike price and selling at the much higher current price.
