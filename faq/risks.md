# Risks

**What do you mean by UPSIDE vs DOWNSIDE options?** \
Upside DIPs are covered call options and Downside DIPs are protected put options
since they are fully collateralized positions. Yield as an option premium is
paid to sell the "upside" or "downside" outcomes.\
Similar for Staking Options, Upside = Calls, Downside = Puts.

**Can I withdraw after staking but before expiration?** \
No, DIPs can only be withdrawn after expiration. However, you receive the
premium amount upfront upon staking, which can be put to use elsewhere.

**What happens to my Staking Option tokens after expiration if they are not exercised?** \
If you choose not to exercise an Staking Option, then the option expires
worthless. The Staking Options tokens will remain in your wallet, but they are
not exercisable.

**What is the worst-case scenario for DIP?** \
The worst-case scenario is that you end up with all stablecoins, effectively
selling your tokens at the strike price of the DIP that you deposited in which
will happen when the market rallies while deposited.

**What is the worst-case scenario for Staking Option?** \
With a staking option, the user is the one holding the option. Either it expires
worthless, or the user can exchange tokens at the ratio in the Staking Option.
Exercise is physically settled and not automatic. Dual Finance does not make any
recommendations on whether you should exercise a Staking Option or not, so
always do your own research before exercising any SO and make sure the price
makes sense to exercise.

**What is the best-case scenario for DIP?** \
The best-case scenario is that you earn the premium immediately from staking
into a DIP and the staked asset's price at expiry is just below the strike
price.

**What is the best-case scenario for Staking Option?** \
The price of the token of the Staking Option you earned rallies, allowing you to
exercise to buy the token for the strike price at a discount to the market
rate.
