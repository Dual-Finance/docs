# Token

Q: How is the DUAL token distributed?\
A: DUAL is the first token being distributed only using options!

Q: What is unique about DUAL's option only distribution?\
A: Token supply depends only on the price of the token as determined by the option holders. There are no vesting schedules, so the token does not get inflated away over time.

Q: What is meant by a fair launch?\
A: Insiders, venture capital investors have no allocations of tokens. There was no pre or public sale. The Community Seed Airdrop was the first ability for DUAL to begin circulating and was rewarded for zero premium or upfront cost. In fact, the initial earmarked amount for investment was reallocated to the community to have as pure of a testing ground as possible for the Staking Option token distribution methodology.

Q: Does the team have any tokens? What is their incentive?\
A: No at launch the team has no allocation of tokens or options on DUAL. The plan is to generate value to the Dual DAO and encourage the community vote on what that compensation should be when token governance can achieve quorum, initially set to 1% of total supply.

Q: What was the Community Seed Airdrop (CSA)?\
A: Participation based incentive program that rewarded early users of DIPs, Staking Options, Airflop Poker Tournament players, feedback form completion and several non-team contributors. The CSA occurred on March 2nd, 2023 and was the first time DUAL became exercisable. The CSA includes 5 tranches of options with increasing strikes and expiration dates. In total 872 accounts received the ability to claim DUAL Staking Options.&#x20;

Q: Why is the token necessary?\
A: Apart from its ability to govern the future of the Dual Finance protocol from the Dual DAO in an open and decentralized manner, the token hold utility for the protocol as a example and reference implementation to other projects that might be unsure of using option based incentive programs. The success of the DUAL token therefore directly impacts the marketability of the protocol and its products.

Q: How can I use the token for governance in the Dual DAO?\
A: Voting on Realms. See [https://app.gitbook.com/o/X0uNY1vwrauQ0VPoBTvr/s/bsQwTZST7WBDVtaZcTWp/\~/changes/3/dual-tokenomics/dual-dao](../dual-tokenomics/dual-dao/)

Q: How can I determine whether it makes sense to exercise my DUAL Staking Options?\
A: DUAL markets will be illiquid to begin, meaning in order to exercise you must have conviction in the fundamental price of the token and be confident holding it until liquidity develops. As with any financial decision more risk means potentially more reward. In theory, the Community Seed Airdrop presents an opportunity to participate at levels that are normally reserved for only VC investment. Do your own research & always make decisions for yourself without outside influence.
