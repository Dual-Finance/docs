# Dual Investment Pools (DIP)

Dual Investment Pools, similar in structure to more commonly known Decentralized Option Vaults (DOVs) but with real-time pricing and customizable yields. They are also physically settled, meaning you will end up with either your staked asset or stablecoins upon withdrawing after expiration. Premiums are also paid immediately upon staking so you can put your funds to work for longer.\
