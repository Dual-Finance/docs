# Dual Investment Pools (DIP)

Dual Finance has advanced decentralized option vaults by creating Dual Investment Pools (DIPs), offering real-time yield strategies for your crypto assets. A variety of strikes and expirations are available with premiums paid out in stablecoins (USDC). Yields are presented as APY% for ease of comparison across different DIPs and to enable users to customize strategies based on their own risk appetite and objectives.\
\
DIPs are also physically settled, meaning that upon expiration and withdrawal either your staked asset or stablecoins will be returned to you depending on if the options expired in-the-money (ITM) or out-of-the-money (OTM). Premiums are paid immediately upon staking, increasing capital efficiency and allowing users to put the premium payment to work during the life of the option.\
\
DIPs serve as an example of a product that can be sustainably incentivized though utilizing Staking Options within a liquidity mining program.\
