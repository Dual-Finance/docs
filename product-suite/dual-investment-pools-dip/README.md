# Dual Investment Pools (DIP)

Dual Finance has upgraded decentralized option vaults (DOVs), by creating Dual Investment Pools (DIPs) offering streaming executable yield strategies. Customize strategies based on your risk appetite and earn yield immediately.\
\
DIPs are also physically settled, meaning you will end up with either your staked asset or stablecoins upon withdrawing after expiration - the risk are these dual outcomes. Premiums are paid immediately upon staking, allowing users to put funds to work for longer. \
\
DIPs serve as an example of a product that can be sustainably incentivized though utilizing Staking Options within a liquidity mining program.\
