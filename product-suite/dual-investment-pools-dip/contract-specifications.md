****DIP Contract Specifications\
\
Dual Finance offers European & American style physically-settled options through its DIP product.\
\
European style options may be exercised on expiry date starting at 8:00 UTC over a 4 hour settlement window. Physical exercise does not happen automatically. Affirmation via an on-chain transaction is required to exercise. Dual Finance allows easy set up of email alerts for any expiring positions.\
\
Physical settlement means that at exercise, the DIP staker (writer of the options contract) will sell their collateral to the DIP owner at the strike price. Settlement of the assets bought/sold through exercise occurs in the exercise transaction. Stakers are further required to withdraw funds any time following the expiration date and time to recover the resulting assets.\
\
DIPs are priced and exercised in USDC (other stablecoins to come). DIP upside products are equivalent to call options, the staker is giving the right to the owner to buy the asset at the strike price.  DIP downside products are equivalent to put options, the staker is giving the right to the owner to sell the asset at the strike price.\

New strikes are listed once per day on best efforts or as necessitated by market movements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Expiration Date/Time    | Every Friday, at 08:00:00 UTC                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Option Style            | <p>European style DIPs may be exercised only on the day of expiration. There is a 4 hour settlement window starting at 8:00 UTC. </p><p>Email alerts will be available to set notifications of any expiring positions.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Settlement Type         | Physically settled options, meaning the asset is bought or sold at the strike price and creates a settlement liability for the exerciser. The exerciser must supply stablecoins (USDC) for Upside exercises and tokens for downside exercises. The resulting asset is paid to the exerciser from the collateral pool within the same transaction.                                                                                                                                |
| Multiplier              | <p>1</p><p>On Dual Finance there is no multiplier. Each contract has only 1 token as the underlying asset.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Collateral              | DIPs are fully collateralized by the staker. For example to sell 10 BTC DIPs, 10 BTC need to be staked. Rehypothecated Lending Pools will allow this collateral to be lent out and earn an APY. TBA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Withdrawal              | DIPs can be withdrawn only after the expiration date and time by the staker. If an Upside DIP was exercised stakers receive stablecoins (USDC), if not they receive back their full amount of tokens. Partial exercise is an unlikely possibility resulting in a mix of assets withdrawable. There is no withdrawal expiration, but it is suggested stakers withdraw shortly following expiration.                                                                               |
| Backstop Liquidity      | This pricing model kicks in if there are no external quotes provided on a DIP. The backstop pricing model will generally be less aggressive than external quotes and runs a fixed implied volatility input into a simple black-scholes formula to determine option prices.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Fees                    | <p>No fixed exchange fees. Implied volatility spread applied to external quoting ranging from 2% to 5%. Simple black-scholes formula with backstop liquidity parameters will be used to calculate Vega and dollarize the end price displayed to stakers.<br><br><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/4sVGhnYlsP1BYcUaTOmeg4NG3x4-lZ6xrbUlAjA7JBzOPpQOFDw7Q0NIXmV2mQg493I04Zz8isM4hu-Oz_WSN7NERWcTi5QS9JzfN6mgGyxt_sMcdLI12SksDz8scaZauLmg46iTygqNEChHa3Fng9o" alt=""></p> |

Operational Specifications:

\


User execution and settlement is handled on-chain at the time of staking or withdrawal.

\


Market Maker executions occur off-chain with on-chain settlement via Solana mainnet. Market Makers are suggested to pre-fund their Dual Settlement Account with 100,000 USDC to maintain valid off-chain bids on all contracts. Market makers retain full custody of the USDC in the premium account; it can be withdrawn in full at any time but would cause outages from bids being populated through the protocol.\
\
If premium within the account cannot support new quotes, then they will be rejected. When premium is withdrawn from the Dual Settlement Account, all outstanding bids are canceled via the deadman switch and will need to be replaced. Notice will be provided if intraday premium deposits are required to avoid interruption.\
\
Settlement of DIP tokens is automatic to their Owner Account. DIP trades will debit USDC on the Settlement Account which requires periodic top ups back to threshold to maintain bids on all DIPs.
