# Liquidity Staking Options (LSO)

Liquidity Staking Options (LSO) reward users who stake into DIPs.\
\
LSOs represent a major improvement to existing crypto liquidity mining schemes, which reward users directly with tokens causing token inflation and encourage mercenary capital purely focused on farming and selling tokens.\
\
By applying Staking Options to this problem, users are still incentivized through token upside but if the rewards go unexercised the token does not inflate supply.
