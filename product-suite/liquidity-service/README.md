# Liquidity Service

Grant token options to the market maker of your choice to ensure transparency and openness. Acquire expensive liquidity services by paying only in options tokens, an on-chain, non-inflationary product that raises treasury funds on the back of the any exercise.\
\
Tokenize standard loan & call market making deal structures by creating the same market dynamic on-chain. Eliminate unsecured token loans and potential front-running of vesting schedules by linking the token loan to the option. Allow market makers to only borrow tokens on a fully-collateralize basis.\
\
Keeps your token's liquidity on-chain and avoid the pitfalls of dealing with centralized exchange listing fees, counterparty risk and legal overhead. Your business is on-chain why direct your users off of Solana when there are cheaper, fairer, permission-less offerings through DEXs. \
\
Focus liquidity to the most capitally efficient markets with native integrations to [Openbook](https://www.openbook.ag/) & [Manifest](https://www.manifest.trade/).
