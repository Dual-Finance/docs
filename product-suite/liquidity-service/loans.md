Market Making Loans
{% endembed %}

Choose between three different pre-configured loans

1. Degen - The shortest loan and least liquidity provided but a useful way to experiment with the service offered and ape in.
2. Launch - Best for projects who want some baseline liquidity for their Manifest market but may have limitations on the loan size.
3. Alpha - Full service on-chain liquidity option that concentrates a token's liquidity on-chain rather than on CEXs. Largest loan and longest service period.

Projects only need to select one of the three packages and enter their token mint.

Loans remain fully collateralized at all times so there is no exposure to the market maker, [CKS Systems](https://cks.systems/).  Loans are returnable in the initial tokens provided or in USDC at the repayment price provided. Only if, the loan is returned in USDC is there a 0.0025% fee applied. Otherwise, the market making service is provided without a fee and all tokens are locked until the end of the period.

Market making is provided for the chosen token on [Manifest](https://www.manifest.trade/), the first formally verified, open source, immutable on-chain orderbook. Statistics and performance can be monitored on-chain, including how much of the loan is being utilized.

If your token is pre-launch, too small or too big please use the  [Need Help?](https://discord.com/invite/jvxp8GNZxR) link to get in touch with the team so we can design a custom solution for you.
