\
**Problem:**&#x20;

* Users of protocols are apathetic to their governance&#x20;
* Whales dominate governance proposals
* Negative feedback loop of small voters not mattering
* Quorum can be difficult to reach&#x20;
* DAOs must demonstrate bonafide decentralization to operate

**Solution:**

* Provide incentives to participants in governance
* Equally weight incentives across voters
* Compose a vote verifier with non-inflationary incentives&#x20;
* Evangelize participants to vote for long term best interests
* Create a quantifiable audit trail of decentralization

**Result:**

* Participants in governance voting record is provable on-chain
* Airdrop Staking Option to eligible voters
* Structure out-of-the-money strikes & long maturities
* Exercise further funds the DAO treasury
* Provides small voters an economic reason to vote & stay involved
